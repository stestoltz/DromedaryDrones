# Dromedary Drones - Blue Team

Dromedary Drones is a java project for running a simulation of a drone food delivery service. The project is run through a user interface with settings pages, a results screen, and savable data. The user is able to modify the drone's specs, the location for where the simulation will take place, the points a drone can deliver to, the food and meal items, as well as the number of orders coming in for the drone. 

## Getting Started
In order to get your own copy of this project up and running you will need to have eclipse (or another java IDE), java, and javaFX installed on your computer. Once you have those, all you need to do is clone the repository and you will be able to run the simulation. There are no dependencies needed to be downloaded.

**Which Branch to Clone**
In order to get the sprint1 version of this repository, navigate to branch "sprint1" and either clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.

## Motivation
This project was created in order to check the legitimacy and possibility of
integrating a drone delivery system on college campuses with the option to
extend to other locations. The initial test is checking Grove City College's
ability to run an effective delivery system.

## Tech/Framework Used
This project uses standard coding practices.

**Built With**
- Java
- JavaFX
- Eclipse IDE


## How to Use
Once you have your copy of the project you can go ahead and run the
Main.java class in the javaFXForms package ([Found here](./src/javaFX_Forms/Main.java)). This will display the main form GUI which will allow you to access several settings forms as well as run a
simulation and view the results of that simulation.
